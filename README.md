Prompt:
Write a metaphor for how you would describe the relationship between Components, GameObjects, and Scenes to another student. In the first in-class activity, we described Components as being the “building blocks” of GameObjects, and GameObjects as the “building blocks” of Scenes; come up with your own creative way to visualize and describe this relationship without using the phrase “building blocks”.

Answer:
The whole game is a group of people around the world with the same last name. 
Scenes refer to a small family with this last name.
GameObjects refer to a single person in this family.
Compnents refer to an important working organ inside the person, such as lungs. 
So, the relationship is like, component is an important part of the gameobject as people cannot live without lungs. And gameobjects are necessary as parts of the scenes because if there are no people in a family, the family cannot exist or cannot be called a family. Scenes are a essential part to the whole game as if there is no family with this last name, the last name cannot be called a last name, and a game without scenes will be terrifying as everything is empty.
